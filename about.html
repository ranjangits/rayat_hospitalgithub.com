							<p> Best Medical & Health care Needs to Our Patients </p> <br>
							<br>

							Having been established in 2010, Rayat Bahra Dental College and Hospital is an
							accredited
							dental
							college, approved by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and Dental Council of India
							(letter
							no.V.12017/46/2008-DE) and has constantly strived towards excellence in all aspects.
							Started with the vision of Mr. Gurvinder Singh Bahra and Mr. Nirmal Singh Rayat the
							college
							aims
							at providing quality education and relevant experience to students aspiring a bright
							career
							in
							the Dental and Maxillofacial field.
							It is our endeavor to help the students achieve their dreams in every possible manner.
							Well-qualified and experienced faculty, open platforms for discussions and regular
							assignments
							and assessments are, to name a few, methods by which we encourage our students to excel.
							To help them through this process the college has recently also introduced the concept
							of
							mentors; wherein one mentor is assigned to five students. This gives the student an
							opportunity
							to talk about and discuss any pressing issue, be it personal or academic. Individualized
							care
							and not ‘factory-line’ teaching is the idea behind this step.
							Scholarships from the Rayat Bahra group are also made available to deserving and in-need
							student
