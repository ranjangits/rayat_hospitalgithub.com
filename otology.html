                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">An otolaryngologist is a doctor who specializes in problems of the head
                        and
                        neck. Otolaryngology is
                        a shortened
                        form of the term otorhinolaryngology, which comes from Greek words for ear (oto), nose (rhino),
                        and
                        throat
                        (laryn).

                        Otolaryngologists used to focus solely on problems of the ear, nose, and throat. You may still
                        hear
                        them called
                        an ENT (ear, nose, and throat) or ENT doctors. Over the last 50 years, the specialty has
                        expanded to
                        include all
                        structures of the head and neck except for the eyes and brain.</p>
