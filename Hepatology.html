        <h1>What is hepatology?</h1> <br> Hepatology is distinct from other specialized forms of medicine because of its
        focus
        on organs
        affected by hepatic diseases. Your hepatic system includes the following organs. <br> <br>
        <h1>Liver</h1> <br> Hepatology’s primary focus is on the liver.

        This essential organ is responsible for helping to digest the foods you eat as well as supporting your <br>
        metabolism and getting rid of toxins.

        The liver also helps store and process fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin D3 and vitamin E. <br> <br>
        <h1>Pancreas</h1> <br> <br> Located behind the stomach, the pancreas is responsible for making insulin and
        producing digestive enzymes.

        Acute or chronic pancreatitis can occur when the enzymes involved in digestion damage the pancreas, causing
        serious inflammation.

        This can also happen when the digestive enzymes made by the liver or pancreas can’t be released due to a
        blockage by a stone <br> <br>
        <h1>Gallbladder</h1> <br><br> The gallbladder is a small organ located on the upper-right part of your stomach.

        The gallbladder is a pouch that collects the bile produced by the liver. When you eat a meal, it contracts and
        dumps its contents into the intestines to help with digestion.

        Gallstones can form when bile imbalances occur, thereby blocking bile flow. <br>
